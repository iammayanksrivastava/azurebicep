# Objective 
To outline Metadata management principles which, if committed to, will help understand and standardize the way metadata is managed and organized wihin the D&A Platform​

# Scope 
The scope of the metadata management principles is for entire D&A platform starting from data lake to data consumption hub.


# Metadata Management Principles

- Meta data annotation of data sets must be automated using Artificial Intelligence during ingest.
- Metadata ingestion should be prioritized based on business pains/use cases.​
- Meta data must be described in business as well as technical terms.​
- An approval process must be in place to manually confirm AI-based annotations with low confidence by data owners.​
- Each data set must be classified through a standard set of classification metadata, so it can be identified and catalogued.​
- (Possible) relationships between annotated data sets(Data lineage) must be recognized automatically (through AI) and manually approved. It is important for finding the dependency of data assets.
- Any possible data relationship should be maintained (i.e., Data set ontologies/taxonomies, Entity-Relationship models (i.e., business data models, dimensional models (i.e., analytical data models) )) .
- Any changes in metadata and/or dataset relationships must be logged for lineage purposes.​
- Ensure people in organization know how to access and use metadata and standard access management process defined within RFC should be followed.​
- Metadata quality should be ensured by performing configurable Metadata quality checks at Raw and Curated data layer.
- Metadata should be refreshed automatically on daily/weekly basis. It must reflect all updates and new elements.
- All the versions of metadata must be maintained overtime.
- Metadata should be accessible through an application interface. And should be discoverable via marketplace.
- Metadata must be as complete and comprehensive as possible.
- Different people in organization must be collaborated for making right and approved data assets available.
- Metadata must be secured, should not be accessible outside organization.
